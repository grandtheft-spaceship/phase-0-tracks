# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. ranching allows you to discard a feature or experiment that didn't turn out quite like you hoped
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
records changes to the repository. A good commit is detailed
* What is a merge conflict?
ery merge is a conflict, which leaves you with an index that contains three versions of each file, the versions from each branch and the base.
