Release 2:

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT * FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.user_id=users.id AND reviews.business_id=businesses.id;
1|Bradford|Pitt|3|The Beagle Nightclub|1|5|very good|3|1
3|Angela|Jolie|2|Amir's Towing|2|3|good|2|3
2|Mandy|Kaling|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|2|bad|1|2

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.First_name, users.Last_name, businesses.Name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users, businesses ON reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
Bradford|Pitt|The Beagle Nightclub|5|very good
Angela|Jolie|Amir's Towing|3|good
Mandy|Kaling|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|bad

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
