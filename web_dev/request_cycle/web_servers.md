1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
    * Small is Beautiful
    * Each Program Does One Thing Well
    * Prototype as Soon as Possible
    * Choose Portability Over Efficiency
    * Store Data in Flat Text Files
    * Use Software Leverage
    * Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
    * Avoid Captive User Interfaces
    * Make Every Program a Filter

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

    * A virtual private server is a block of memory that is stored on another computer; which can be remotely accessed and setup to listen and respond to requests from another machine. Some advantages I see for using a VPS is that it can be easily created and managed. It can also be beneficial for smaller sites/applications to get up and running as quick as possible.

3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Acting as root user can be dangerous when running programs because it makes your entire machine/environment vulnerable; either by yourself or an outside threat. You can accidently delete files/directories and have no way to retrieve them. You can open vulnerabilities that allow others access to your machine/environment.
