    * A GET request simply asks and retrieves data from the server

3. What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
    * A cookie is information, or data, that a web site stores locally on a user's hard drive to be used for a later time. It works with HTTP requests wherein the server stores specific information, such as names, passwords, browsing history, etc., so when a user visists the same page later in the future, the server can access the cookie and all of its saved, relative information on it.
